# Project_Tetris
# This contains the game code for tetris game which I developed earlier. 

The UI is minimalistic and Modern and the game GUI elements are properly designed to draw the shapes in the L, S, Z, T etc.

This game is implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The game features different block shapes that fall down the screen, and the player's goal is to rotate and move the blocks to create complete horizontal lines. When a line is complete, it is removed from the board, and the player earns points. The game ends when the blocks stack up to the top of the screen.

The game window is set up using Pygame, and the necessary colors, block shapes, and game variables are defined. The main game loop handles user input, updates the game state, and redraws the screen accordingly. The game includes features such as a score panel, next block preview, game over message, and a pause function.

To play the game, simply run the run_game() function. The game starts with a start screen, and you can press the Enter key to begin. Use the arrow keys to move the blocks left, right, and down. Press the Up arrow key to rotate the blocks. Press the P key to pause the game. When the game is over, the game over screen is displayed, and you can press Enter to start a new game.
